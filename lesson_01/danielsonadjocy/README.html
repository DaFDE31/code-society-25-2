<h2>Expertise</h2>
<p>As I said before, I am mostly into data science and software engineering.  With data science I mostly have experience coding with machine learning and displaying data in different forms and graphs. As for software engineering, I am most comfortable in front end design particularly in Javascript using React or React Native. I do however, have some backend experience in modeling relational databases and making them using SQL and Python. Thanks to tutoring and my time at college I have plenty of time working in a group to accomplish a task, both with peers and while trying to help others with their needs.</p>
