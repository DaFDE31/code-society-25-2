## Prerequisites

Here are some of the things I need to be a productive citizen and engineer.

* Single-origin, medium roast coffee from Africa.
* Daily Bible study and prayer
* Jazz / hip-hop fusion with strong piano lines, bass, and drums. Favorite artists right now are [Kiefer][kiefer-link], [Glimlip][glimlip-link], [Ashley Henry][ashley-henry-link], and [Tom Misch][tom-misch-link].
* Not operational on Sunday's. That's the Lord's Day so I'm closed for business.
* Smoked meats and BBQ of pretty much any variety (pork, beef, chicken, lamb, etc.).

## Installation Instructions

1. It's best to get in touch with me after 9am PT on most days. I'm not an early riser.
1. I'm instant human, just add coffee.
1. There is usually no shortage of things I need to do on any given day as a full-time entrepreneur, so scheduling time with me is usually best. I'm good at ignoring ad-hoc messages.
1. Email communication is the best as my inbox is one of the tools I use for priority management. There's a high chance I will miss messages on LinkedIn and Twitter, so don't be afraid to ping me again if I don't respond in a timely manner.
1. Before you ask me a question about your tech career, make sure to check my blog at [anthonydmays.com/blog](https://anthonydmays.com/blog) to ensure that I haven't already answered it. I also cross post articles on LinkedIn and Medium.
