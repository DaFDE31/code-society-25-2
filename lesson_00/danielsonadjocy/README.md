## Expertise
As I said before, I am mostly into data science and software engineering.  With data science I mostly have experience coding with machine learning and displaying data in different forms and graphs. As for software engineering, I am most comfortable in front end design particularly in Javascript using React or React Native. I do however, have some backend experience in modeling relational databases and making them using SQL and Python.
